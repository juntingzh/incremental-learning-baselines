# Efficient Lifelong Learning with A-GEM

This is forked from the [official implementation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/agem) of the [Averaged Gradient Episodic Memory (A-GEM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00420) in Tensorflow.

## Requirements

TensorFlow >= v1.9.0.

## Training

To replicate the results of the paper on a particular dataset, execute (see the Note below for downloading the CUB and AWA datasets):
```bash
$ ./replicate_results.sh <DATASET> <THREAD-ID> <JE>
```
Example runs are:
```bash
$ ./replicate_results.sh MNIST 3      /* Train PNN and A-GEM on MNIST */
$ ./replicate_results.sh CUB 1 1      /* Train JE models of RWALK and A-GEM on CUB */
```

### Note
For CUB and AWA experiments, download the dataset prior to running the above script. Run following for downloading the datasets:

```bash
$ ./download_cub_awa.sh
```
The plotting code is provided under the folder `plotting_code/`. Update the paths in the plotting code accordingly.
 
When using this code, please cite our papers:
